novapost.cookbot is a contextual execution handler.

It's goal is not to replace :doc:`other tools, such as provisioning software
</about/alternatives>`.

Various persons can operate on a project: developers, sysadmins, integrators...
Since, different actors have different interests, **collaboration matters**.

As an example, developers are not always aware of security, whereas sysadmins
are not always aware of functionality.

What do they share? They all use some architecture components.

* Actors work in some environments, i.e. prod or dev.
* Environments are deployed in some physical networks and hardware, i.e. in
  the cloud, on a hosted server, on a local machine.
* Architecture differs depending on environments.

Architecture is configuration.

As a member of a project's team, I want:

* to focus on my job, i.e. reuse other's work.
* to deploy an architecture quickly, i.e. use automated install scripts.
* to customize things I really need to.

What do I need?

* an igniter: a light package I can use as a start point. It contains minimal
  configuration and scripts to start with the project and install additional
  tools.

* configuration templates: customize a few variables and generate full
  project's configuration.

* contextual execution manager: run generic commands to control customized
  architecture configuration.

* other tools, such as provisioning servers and clients, remote execution
  managers, configuration managers, ...
